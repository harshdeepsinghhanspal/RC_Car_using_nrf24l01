# RC_Car_using_nrf24l01

[+] Just a simple RC Car🚗 using NRF24L01📡

[+] One arduino circuit will act like transmitter📡 which will be the controller🎮

[+] Other arduino circuit will act as receiver📡 which will be present in the car🚗

[+] Better use L298N motor driver as the code👩‍💻 is designed accordingly...
